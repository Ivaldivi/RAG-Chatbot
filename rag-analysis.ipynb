    "# RAG Chatbot Analysis\n",
    "Author: Izzy Valdivia\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background: \n",
    "I created a basic chatbot enhanced with RAG. RAGs are used to enhance the knowledge base of a generative LLM to extend the context window or bolster the background on a specific topic. This also means the model does not need to be re-trained to contain specialized information. For example, I decided to use OpenAI's `gpt-5` as the basis for my chatbot and then gave it more context to answer questions specific to Vashon- an Island of ~11k people in the Puget Sound west of Seattle. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools: \n",
    "* Model: OpenAI's gpt-5\n",
    "* Database: chromadb\n",
    "* Pdf Parser: pyPDF\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup: \n",
    "I have included an environment.yml file with all required dependencies.\n",
    "You will need to get an API key from OpenAI in order to run this tutorial. You will then need to add it to a .env file that is located in the root of the project that contains the line:  \n",
    "`OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your-api-key\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG Testing\n",
    "A cornerstone of a good chatbot is honesty & depth of knowledge. I have specifically instructed the chatbot to admit when it does not have the answer to the question you have asked. The idea behind this request is to reduce the amount of incorrect information that the chatbot provides. Instead of guessing about context from the documents it is referencing, it should encourage you to seek out a different source. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, I have instructed the chatbot to cite its sources. This should allow the user to dig into any of the RAG refernce materials and help make fact-checking faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will be testing to see if the chatbot admits when it does not know the answer to the user's question as well as consistently cites its source. \n"
